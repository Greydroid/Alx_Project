# Alx_Project
this repository shows my project "VetTrack" which i am currently working on in Alx

currently i have achieved creating models such as User, animals, vaccination and reminders.

my next project is to make it public friendly by incorporating css and html into it so as to enable it to be used by others and not just me the admin
